# Battleship
An implementation of the Batatleship game, written in Javascript.

Player vs. Computer only.
Ships are randomly placed at the beginning of every game.
The computer has basic AI: it randomly searches until it finds a ship, and then it latches onto the ship and hits surrounding cells until the entire ship has been sunk.
